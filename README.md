# pebble-packman

A Pebble watchapp/watchface written in C using the Pebble SDK.

## Building & running

```sh
pebble build                          # build for all targetPlatforms
pebble install --emulator emery       # install on the emery emulator
pebble install --phone <ip>           # install to a paired phone
```

## Target platforms

`targetPlatforms` in `package.json` controls which watches you build for. This
project includes **basalt** (Pebble Time) alongside chalk, diorite, emery,
flint, and gabbro. Basalt uses Diorite's 144×168 rectangular layout and its
own color display renders the same palette used by Emery.

## Project layout

```
src/c/           C source for the watchapp
src/pkjs/        PebbleKit JS (phone-side) source, if any
worker_src/c/    Background worker source, if any
resources/       Images, fonts, and other bundled resources
package.json     Project metadata (UUID, platforms, resources, message keys)
wscript          Build rules — usually no need to edit
```

By default this project is configured as a watchapp. To make it a watchface,
set `pebble.watchapp.watchface` to `true` in `package.json`.
